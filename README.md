# Surfs-Up

## Overview
This analysis uses jupyter notebooks via Python to read and analyze Hawaii weather data from an sqlite file. Specifically, I wanted to look at the data from June and December to see if a Surf and Ice Cream shop is viable all year long. 

## Results

- Average Temperatures 
    - The December average temp is only about 4 degrees cooler than in June with the Dec average temp at 71° and June at 75°.
- Interquartile Range
    - Although the min in December is 56°, it appears to be an outlier from the below box. The middle 50% of the data lies between 69° and 74° in December. 

## Summary 
The average temperatures in June are only slightly higher than in December, therefore I do not think it would impact the business that much. I ran queries to filter the precipitation in both June and December. 

The average precipitation 0.14 for June and 0.22 for December. While that might not seem like much, total precipitation for all the data in June is 214.63 and in December is 304.63.
